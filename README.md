# Neo-Bank Fintech Project üè¶

Welcome to the Neo-Bank Fintech Project! This project aims to analyze user engagement and retention in a neo bank environment. The objective is to define a target metric for measuring user engagement, identify engaged and unengaged users, calculate retention by cohorts over time, and provide valuable business recommendations based on the analysis.

## Target Metric

The first step in this project is to define a target metric to measure user engagement. User engagement can be assessed using various metrics such as the number of active days, the frequency of transactions, or the time spent on the platform. We will select a specific metric that best aligns with the goals and characteristics of the neo bank platform.

## Engaged vs. Unengaged Users

Before we define the target metric, it's crucial to distinguish between engaged and unengaged users. In this context, an engaged user can be defined as someone who regularly interacts with the platform, performs transactions, and shows consistent usage patterns. On the other hand, an unengaged user may exhibit infrequent or sporadic interactions, low transactional activity, or minimal usage patterns.

## Business Justification

To justify our definition of engagement, we will conduct a thorough analysis of user behavior and associated visualizations. By examining relevant metrics and exploring user patterns, we can identify characteristics that correlate with desired outcomes, such as higher customer satisfaction, increased revenue, or improved user retention. These insights will guide us in selecting the most appropriate target metric.

## Retention Analysis

Retention analysis involves evaluating the longevity of user relationships with the neo bank. We will calculate retention rates by cohorts over time, which allows us to observe how different user groups perform in terms of sustained engagement. By comparing retention rates across cohorts, we can identify which segments of users tend to stay longer with the platform.

## Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we will draw meaningful insights and generate actionable business recommendations. These recommendations may include strategies to enhance user engagement, improve customer experience, target specific user segments, or introduce new features to encourage higher retention rates.

## Context

The neo bank context represents a modern banking environment that primarily operates online, offering a range of digital financial services. Understanding the behavior and preferences of users within this digital ecosystem is crucial for optimizing user experience, driving growth, and ensuring long-term success.

## Problem Statement

The primary goal of this project is to study retention within the neo bank and identify the factors influencing user longevity. We aim to answer questions such as: which users stay longer, what are their characteristics, and what types of transactions are most prevalent among engaged users?

## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics will provide an overview of the user base, including user demographics, geographic distribution, and transactional patterns. By analyzing this information, we can gain valuable insights into user behavior and identify potential correlations with engagement and retention.

## Analysis

Our analysis will tell a comprehensive story about user engagement and retention in the neo bank environment. We will delve into various aspects such as user behavior, transactional patterns, and engagement metrics. By connecting the dots, we aim to uncover meaningful insights and provide a holistic understanding of the factors that contribute to user retention.

## Ad-hoc Analysis in Python

As part of our analysis, we will perform an ad-hoc analysis in Python. We will leverage the power of Python's data analysis libraries to cluster customers based on their product usage and predict churners. This analysis will provide additional insights into user behavior and help identify potential churn risks.

## Tech Stack

### This project utilizes the following tech stack:

- Data Warehouse: Google BigQuery: We will use Google BigQuery as our data warehouse to store and retrieve the relevant data for analysis.
- Data visualization: Looker Studio: Looker Studio will be used for data visualization to create visually appealing and interactive dashboards, charts, and reports that provide clear insights into user engagement and retention.
- Data Wrangling & Exploration: DBT, SQL, Python: For exploratory analysis, we will leverage DBT (SQL) and Python. DBT will allow us to write SQL queries and transformations to explore the data, while Python will enable us to perform advanced analytics, machine learning, and ad-hoc analysis.

## Getting Started

### To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    
     `git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git`

2. Set up the necessary dependencies and environment. Ensure that you have the required versions of Python, DBT, Looker Studio, and access to Google BigQuery.

3. Retrieve the dataset from Google BigQuery or import your own dataset into the project. Ensure that the dataset contains the relevant user engagement and transactional data.

4. Explore the project files, including SQL queries, Python scripts, and visualization templates, to gain an understanding of the project structure and workflow.

5. Customize the analysis based on your specific needs, such as adjusting the target metric, exploring additional user attributes, or refining the ad-hoc analysis.

6. Execute the analysis pipeline by running the SQL queries, Python scripts, and visualization templates in the appropriate order.

7. Interpret the results, generate visualizations, and extract meaningful insights from the analysis.

8. Document your findings, recommendations, and key takeaways in the README or a separate report.

9. Share the results with your team, stakeholders, or clients, and collaborate on implementing the recommended strategies to improve user engagement and retention.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of user engagement and retention in the neo bank environment. By defining a target metric, identifying engaged and unengaged users, calculating retention by cohorts, and conducting ad-hoc analysis, we gain valuable insights to drive business decisions and improve user experiences. With the combined power of Google BigQuery, Looker Studio, DBT, and Python, we can efficiently explore, analyze, and visualize the data, enabling data-driven strategies for optimizing user engagement and fostering long-term customer relationships.

We welcome contributions, feedback, and suggestions to further enhance this project. Let's work together to unlock the full potential of user engagement and retention in the neo bank ecosystem. Happy analyzing!
